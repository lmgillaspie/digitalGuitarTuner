# digitalGuitarTuner

As part of our EE421: Signals & Systems class at the University of Kentucky, we implemented and expanded on a digital guitar tuner project we found online. The Instructable we based our project on is: http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Guitar-Tuner/ . In this project, we edited the original frequency detection Arduino code from here: http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Frequency-Detection/ .
